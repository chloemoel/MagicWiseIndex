# MagicWise Index

This tool is intended to be used to used to create a comprehensive score to compare two or more groups and identify causal genes. This is done in two parts with BeWISE (Burden Estimate from Weighted Integration of Site-specific Epigenetic Changes) and BeMAGIC (Burden Estimate from Modified and Associated Genetic Change) to create the MagicWise Index.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Combined Burden Estimate is run using [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io). There are several ways to install and manage nextflow as noted on their website. Once installed, run the following to insure proper setup. 

```
# Run from directory that nextflow is installed in
./nextflow run hello
```

To download the code to run Combined Burden Estimate, run

```
git clone https://github.com/chloemoel/MagicWiseIndex

cd CombinedBurdenEstimate
```

This pipeline was written with [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/introduction.html) containers. Please note, these files are fairly large. Please make sure you have adequate space. Additionally, these containers must be auto mounted (shown in example below), or have data mounted after install. 

To install container images and necessary files, run: 

```
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

### Config File Creation

This pipeline is run dependent on a nextflow config file saved in the base directory of the workflow. This is an example of a config file

```
/////////////
// parameters
params {
  outdir              = "outputs"
  tracedir            = "${params.outdir}/pipeline_info"
  email_to            = 'youremail@email.com'
  pipeline_email      = true
  batch_correction    = ["Sentrix_ID"]
  additional_data     = "/user_data/additional_data.csv"
  sample_sheet        = "/user_data/sample_sheet.csv"
  sample_m_vals       = "/user_data/methylation_values.csv"
  vcf                 = "/user_data/merged.vcf"
}

/////////////
// timeline, report, trace, dag setup
timeline {
  enabled = true
  file = "${params.tracedir}/execution_timeline.html"
  overwrite = true
}
report {
  enabled = true
  file = "${params.tracedir}/execution_report.html"
  overwrite = true
}
trace {
  enabled = true
  overwrite = true
  file = "${params.tracedir}/execution_trace.txt"
  fields = "task_id,hash,native_id,process,tag,name,status,exit,module,container,cpus,time,disk,memory,attempt,submit,start,complete,duration,realtime,queue,%cpu,%mem,rss,vmem,peak_rss,peak_vmem,rchar,wchar,syscr,syscw,read_bytes,write_bytes"
}
dag {
  enabled = true
  file = "${params.tracedir}/pipeline_dag.svg"
  overwrite = true
}
///////////////
// notifications
notification {
    enabled = params.pipeline_email
    to = "${params.email_to}"
}
///////////////
// profiles 
profiles {
    high_computing_cluster {
      singularity.enabled = true
      singularity.cacheDir = "${projectDir}/bin"
      singularity.autoMounts = true
      process {
        executor = 'sge'
        queue = 'yourqueue'
        memory = 256.GB
            cpus = 56
        penv = 'smp'
    }
    }

     local {
        process.executor = 'local'
        singularity.enabled = true
        singularity.cacheDir = "${projectDir}/bin"
        singularity.autoMounts = true
    }
}
```

### Input File formats

* sample_sheet (csv file) -- this sample sheet is used for the BeWISE calculation only, as the genetic score depends on a vcf with headers as study id names. This sample sheet is based on the Illumina sample sheet format with headers as follows: Sample_Name,Sample_Well,Sample_Plate,Sample_Group,Pool_ID,Sentrix_ID,Sentrix_Position. Only Sample_Name, Sentrix_ID, and Sentrix_Position are required. Sample name MUST match the headers of the vcf file. 
* additional_data (csv file) -- this a sheet with additional data used for batch correction during the BeWISE calculation. This csv file must contain the study id in the first column, and then any other information in subsequent columns
* sample_m_vals (csv file) -- a file with probes as rows and samples as columns. Samples should be in the [Sentrix_ID]_[Sentrix_Position] format. To calculate m values, we use `SeSAME` (more info can be found [here](https://zhou-lab.github.io/sesame/v1.16/sesame.html)). Probes should be in either the EPIC or 450k array format (NOT EPICv2). 
* vcf -- a multisample vcf file with all samples included in a single file. QC for genotyping calls should be done before running this tool.
* batch_correction -- list of variables to correct for in batch correction during BeWISE. Should be either in the sample_sheet file (ie, Sentrix_ID for chip correction) or a column from the additional data file. 

### Useage

To run this pipeline after you have installed nextflow, run the install script, and have created your config file:

```
./path/to/nextflow run main.nf -profile high_computing_cluster
```

If you are running after editing a file, you can run the following to resume

```
./path/to/nextflow run main.nf -profile high_computing_cluster -resume
```

Your score outputs can be found in the `outputs` directory
